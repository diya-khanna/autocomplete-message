""" This program makes it faster for users to complete typing messages by predicting the next word they are about to type based on observations of previously typed text. It is a predictive text algorithm similar to the algorithm that smartphones use to suggest words as you type. It uses dictionaries to store the associations between each word in the text and a list of words that we've observed following that original word."""
